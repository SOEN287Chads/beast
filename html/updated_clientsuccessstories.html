	<h3>Great workouts</h3>
	<p>I've only been using this website for a bit and it's really helped me get stronger, my first workout really pushed me and helped me realize how out of shape I was. This website really has everything and creates an awesome workout plan catered to your body, schedule, and what you have available to you. 6/5 stars in my opinion.</p>

	<h3>Best fitness website I've used</h3>
	<p>I have used multiple fitness websites over the years. BeastFit is by far the best one. Lots of options and the premium version has way more features and workouts than other premium options I've seen.</p>

	<h3>Actual workout</h3>
	<p>I'm an athlete, and weight lift quite a bit, and with all gyms shut down, I cannot go to the gyms anymore, so this website was a quick remedy for my workout fix.</p>

	<h3>The Workout Website You Need</h3>
	<p>I've used several workout websites. Each of them offer something in particular. BeastFit offers them all. It's by far the best workout website that I've used. It's easy for novices and will push you to the max each and every workout. On top of all of this, their service department is top notch. If you have an issue or a question, all you have to do is send them an email and they will be in touch within minutes. Plus, they are so nice and helpful. My kudos to the makers and staff that made / maintain this website, just fantastic!</p>

	<h3>Workout website that makes you want to sweat!</h3>
	<p>The real testament to how great this website is the fact that I will probably spend the money on the subscription! This is by far the best workout website that I have had so far. Yes, it may not have as of an extensive exercise library as some but the quality and ease of it all makes it worth it. Being able to choose a set of alternatives, choose your intensity level, and choose the category of your workout based on your goals was awesome. Also having the timers integrated into the workouts and being able to add the weight you were using as you went along makes it so easy to use. The only suggestions that I would make would be to allow the user to go back to the previous exercises in order to add the weight they used. I kept on forgetting to do it and had to even do a workout restart in order to add them. Also adding a feature so that you can change your rep and set scheme would be useful. Other than that, as long as y’all keep adding to the exercise database this app will only get better even without my suggestions. </p>

	<h3>Life changing</h3>
	<p>I love this website. I had no where to start and was (still am) scared of the gym. This website is so detailed and thorough and I’ve only used it for a few weeks and notice a difference. I’m excited for the new updates specifically the dumbbell body weight exercises. So many different options. Love love love it!</p>

	<h3>By far the Best fitness website</h3>
	<p>I have been into physical fitness in one form or another my entire life. Competitively swimming, weight lifting, and running have been staples of mine. I have tried to find and easy to use website to track my workouts and coach me on those days that I don't have the motivation to create my own workout. This website is perfect for both. I highly recommended it to fellow athletes. </p>

	<h3>Wonderful website</h3>
	<p>I've never had a workout program that I loved more or stuck to more than this. Fun, easy to use, and always an awesome Challenge. It's taken me from timid gym goer to a confident gym lover.</p>

	<h3>Game changer!</h3>
	<p>As a former Division 1 Collegiate Athlete, I always had trouble knowing what exact exercises to do on my own. This website has everything you need for any goals you set for yourself whether it’s to bulk up, lean out, or just shed some weight. Easy to use and keep track of your goals. Highly Recommend 10/10</p>
