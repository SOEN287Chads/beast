1. Always work in a new feature in a branch different than main
2. Always git pull before git push
3. Do not merge into master right away, start a pull request so that others can review your changes
4. When in doubt, communicate with the team and as always your best friend: StackOverflow

Branch name convention:
Keep it short and simple. For instance, if you are working on a feature that lets you add a billing page, the brach name can be billing-page

Commit name convention:
Always add a meaningful message to the commits. Keep it in present tense. Do not write something like "Update on menu". 
It should be more like "Add like button to main menu"
